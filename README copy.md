# 420-406-AB Data Structures (Winter 2020)

I will add assignments, code and any extras as we cover them in class, so make sure you are receiving
notifications on this repository and are syncing with the repository regularly.

The project in the `code` folder contains one "main" class per week, containing code from the theory
portion of our course. You can run the week's lecture examples using the IntelliJ run configuration
corresponding to the week. When you run the application, a menu will present example methods for you
to choose from.
